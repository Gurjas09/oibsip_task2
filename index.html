            BIOGRAPHY
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary
             who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to
              be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.He later took part in a largely
               symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail,
                which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
                 household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and 
                 folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he
                  electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection 
                  within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for 
                  India's independence.
